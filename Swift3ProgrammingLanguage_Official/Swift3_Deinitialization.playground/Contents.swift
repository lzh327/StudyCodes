//*************************** Deinitialization *********************************
//A deinitializer is called immediately before a class instance is deallocated. You write deinitializers with the deinit keyword, similar to how initializers are written with the init keyword. Deinitializers are only available on class types.

//How Deinitialization Works
//Swift automatically deallocates your instances when they are no longer needed, to free up resources. Swift handles the memory management of instances through automatic reference counting (ARC). Typically you don’t need to perform manual cleanup when your instances are deallocated. However, when you are working with your own resources, you might need to perform some additional cleanup yourself. For example, if you create a custom class to open a file and write some data to it, you might need to close the file before the class instance is deallocated.

//Class definitions can have at most one deinitializer per class. The deinitializer does not take any parameters and is written without parentheses:
//deinit{
//perform the deinitialization
//}

//Deinitializers are called automatically, just before instance deallocation takes place. You are not allowed to call a deinitializer yourself. Superclass deinitializers are inherited by their subclasses, and the superclass deinitializer is called automatically at the end of a subclass deinitializer implementation. Superclass deinitializers are always called, even if a subclass does not provide its own deinitializer.

//Because an instance is not deallocated until after its deinitializer is called, a deinitializer can access all properties of the instance it is called on and can modify its behavior based on those properties (such as looking up the name of a file that needs to be closed).

//*************************** Deinitializers in Action *********************************
class Bank {
    static var coinsInBank = 10_000
    static func distribute(coins numberOfCoinsRequested: Int) -> Int {
        let numberOfCoinsToVend = min(numberOfCoinsRequested, coinsInBank)
        coinsInBank -= numberOfCoinsRequested
        return numberOfCoinsToVend
    }
    static func receive(coins: Int) {
        coinsInBank += coins
    }
}

class Player {
    var coinsInPurse: Int
    init(coins: Int) {
        coinsInPurse = Bank.distribute(coins: coins)
    }
    func win(coins: Int) {
        coinsInPurse += Bank.distribute(coins: coins)
    }
    deinit{
        Bank.receive(coins: coinsInPurse)
    }
}

var playerOne: Player? = Player(coins: 100)
print("A new player has joined the game with \(playerOne!.coinsInPurse) coins")
print("There are now \(Bank.coinsInBank) coins left in the bank")

playerOne!.win(coins: 2_000)
print("PlayerOne won 2000 coins & now has \(playerOne!.coinsInPurse) coins")
print("The bank now only has \(Bank.coinsInBank) coins left")

playerOne = nil
print("PlayerOne has left the game")
print("The bank now has \(Bank.coinsInBank) coins")

//The player has now left the game. This is indicated by setting the optional playerOne variable to nil, meaning “no Player instance.” At the point that this happens, the playerOne variable’s reference to the Player instance is broken. No other properties or variables are still referring to the Player instance, and so it is deallocated in order to free up its memory. Just before this happens, its deinitializer is called automatically, and its coins are returned to the bank.
